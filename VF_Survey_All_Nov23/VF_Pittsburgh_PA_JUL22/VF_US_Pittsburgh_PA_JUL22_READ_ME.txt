Description of Survey Respondents: This survey was sent to a random sample of English-speaking GoDaddy customers who are residents located 
within the United States. Respondents also must have at least one active microbusiness venture which includes a unique domain with a web presence 
and a service such as email or payments. Survey respondents also must have opted in to receiving marketing/promotional emails from GoDaddy.

Venture Forward’s mission is to bring into focus the benefits of building a more inclusive economy for communities by providing valuable 
information on the impact of microbusinesses, which are often too small or too new to show up in traditional methods of capturing economic data. 
Since the launch of Venture Forward, we’ve talked to hundreds of policymakers and influencers – all of whom see how much more potential these 
everyday entrepreneurs have to positively impact their communities. We’ve worked with mayors and economic developers to inform programs and the 
allocation of funds.
